EU4_NAME;Viva la Rivoluzione!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EU4_DESC;The creation of a unified Italian state in 1610 seismically shifted the balance of power in Europe. Where once the northern powers had free reign to meddle in Italian affairs, unification provided us with the strength to stand up for our natural rights. The subsequent conquests in Greece, north Africa, the Adriatic, the Americas, and Terra Australis have allowed Italy to project her power across the globe. But all is not what it once was - the fire of revolution has spread across the world. While the forces of popular revolt are triumphant for the moment, France's betrayal of the revolutionary values and its descent into absolutism threatens the Republic and all for which it stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
