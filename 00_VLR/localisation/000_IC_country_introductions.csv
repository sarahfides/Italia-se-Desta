EVTNAME2119951;The Woes of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2119951;From the late 17th century onward, and beginning with the Mamluk Revolution - a revolutionary republic lead by a handful of radicals - in 1748, the $COUNTRY$ has been in a near-constant state of decline. Long gone are the glory days of the Mamluk conquest of the Ottoman Empire between 16th and 18th centuries, as our country now lies crumbling and partitioned. Al-Iskandariyah and Al-Qahira, Alexandria and Cairo to the westerners, now lie in Italian hands. To add insult to injury, the local population has adopted the Catholic faith. Will $COUNTRY$ be able to pull itself out of the nadir?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
