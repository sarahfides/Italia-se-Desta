EVTNAME2110101;Slavery in $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110101;At a recent visit to $CAPITAL$ earlier in $YEAR$, a government representative from our colonial overlords became witness to the cruel treatment of the slave population in $COUNTRY$. Though the metropole has outlawed slavery, they have, up to this point, allowed it to continue in the colonies.

EVTOPTA2110101;This does not sound very promising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110102;Slavery in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110102;Though slavery in $COUNTRY$ has been outlawed, this vile institution continues in our various colonial possessions. Most recently, the cruel treatment of the local slave population in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has triggered outrage in the salons of $CAPITAL$, with ever-growing calls for the abolition of slavery across the entire $COUNTRY_ADJ$ empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110102;We shall abolish it at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC2110103;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has issued a decree outlawing the vile institution of slavery throughout its colonial and overseas territories. This is very much a first step, and much will need to be done to ensure racial, economic, and political equity between the emancipated and general populations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110103;A great day for the human race.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110104;Slavery in the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Empire Allowed to Continue;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110104;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has issued a pronouncement that the vile institution of slavery is allowed to continue throughout its territories, even though it is illegal in metropolitan $FROMCOUNTRY$.

EVTNAME2110105;Slave Emancipation in $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110105;In line with $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government directives, the colonial administration has began the process of slave emancipation in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC2110106;Though the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial administration has taken steps to abolish the practice of slavery throughout $COUNTRY$, our colonial overlords are not too pleased with this development.

EVTOPTA2110106;This cannot be good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC2110107;Some of our colonial administrations has taken steps to abolish the practice of slavery throughout their domains, despite repeated warnings from the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government that this was contrary to national and colonial policy.

EVTNAME2110120;The Constitutional Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110120;It has come to our attention that the issue of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ constitution is of concern to our colonial overlords. It seems that changes to the constitutional status quo have allowed for considerable divergence from our metropole's form of government, something which we are given to understand is unacceptable to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110120;This sounds like it could lead to trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110121;The Constitutional Question in the Colonies;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110121;It has come to our attention that a number of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colonies have enacted considerable constitutional reforms in their colonial domains, resulting in an extraordinary level of divergence from our own form of government. This not only undermines our authority, but also acts as a magnet for all sorts of radicals right here at home. Some warn, however, that this could cause backlash in the colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110121;Constitutional reform in the colonies is urgently needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110122;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Constitutional Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110122;As we feared, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has demanded that we amend our constitution so as to align more closely with the constitution of $FROMCOUNTRY$. How we respond to this request could have potentially catastrophic consequences for $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110122;Resistance is futile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB2110122;We will not submit to this tyranny!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110139;The War is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110139;We tried our best to keep $COUNTRY$ independent so as to maintain our constitutional arrangements, but the might of our colonial overlord's arms has forced us to concede defeat. Though the war is lost and we will be forced to accept their constitutional demands, there is yet hope that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag will fly proudly and independently once more, and that we will be free to define the terms of our own self-governance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110139;A dark day for $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110148;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Defiant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110148;We tried to be reasonable with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities, but independist sentiment has taken hold of the local administration. They refuse to, as they put it, "bow down" to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule any longer. It looks like it is not possible to resolve this 'difference of opinion' peacefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA22110148;We must restore order immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB22110148;It's not worth the cost in human lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110201;The Méchicain Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110201;Ever since the first French conquests in Méchico in 1695, competing French and Portuguese colonies in the region have both claimed sovereignty over all of Méchico. 1806 saw France annex a number of Portuguese colonial possessions in the region, and to the present day there still exist two separate colonies, Portuguese Méchico and French Méchique, which claim to be the legitimate government of a unified Méchico. Though previously it was not possible to settle this dispute decicifely in our colony's favour, a diplomatic incident has given us the excuse we need to ensure that Méchique becomes internationally recognised as the sole legitimate colony in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110201;An excellent initiative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB2110201;Let us not waste lives unnecessarily on this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110202;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Annexation of Méchico;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110202;In an outrageous turn of events, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ambassador in $CAPITAL$ had demanded in no unclear terms the full annexation of Méchico, our loyal colony, by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rival colony of Méchique! $FROMCOUNTRY$ is clearly the aggressor, and the international community will surely be appalled by this request. Our government must carefully consider what to do, for sources indicate that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have been gearing up for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110202;We have no choice but to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB2110202;This is an outrageous demand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110203;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts the Annexation of Méchico;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110203;Bowing to immense pressure by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has accepted the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ demands that the colony of Méchico be annexed by the rival $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colony of Méchique, settling a decades-long dispute over sovereignty in Méchico. A humiliating defeat for $FROMCOUNTRY$, but an absolute triumph for $COUNTRY$ and Méchique.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110203;Vive le Méchique!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110204;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Seeks Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110204;Representatives of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ have approached our officials, seeking to establish a formal alliance between $COUNTRY$ and $FROMCOUNTRY$. We are lead to believe that this is directly linked with heightened tensions in the Americas, where rival colonies Méchico and Méchique are embroiled in a sovereignty dispute and is surely heading for all-out war between European powers. The situation could turn very ugly, very fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110204;Let us ally with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB2110204;Not at the present time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110205;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses the Annexation of Méchico;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110205;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused our demand that Méchico be annexed by Méchique. Our spies from within the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ administration tell us that they are in the process of gathering international support for their cause. We should do the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110205;We must rally the Great Powers to our cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110206;It's Now or Never;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110206;The situation in Méchico is spiraling out of control. The time has come to take decisive action and ensure that Méchique is recognised as the sole legitimate authority in Méchico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110206;We should issue an immediate ultimatum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110207;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Issues Méchico Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110207;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has issued an ultimatum to our government - accept the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ terms, that is to say the complete annexation of Méchico by the illegitimate colony of Méchique, or face the might of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ arms. We must not allow this humiliation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110207;It may be humiliating, but it is the only option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME2110208;The Méchican War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110208;All attempts to avoid another bloodbath in Méchico have failed, as representatives from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governments failed to agree to an amicable solution in last-minute talks in $CAPITAL$.

EVTNAME2111032;The New Qin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111032;In 212 BCE, at the order of Qin Shi Huang, first Emperor of China, a mass campaign of anti-intellectualism was carried out which saw book burnings and the murder of Confucian scholars. Following the Great Ming's recent humilation at the hands of the European powers, similar scenes have been taking place throughout Ming, at great human and material cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111032;The horror!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111032;Irrelevant Politics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111032;With our Westernisation, polemics over the benefits or drawbacks of adopting the ways of the West have largely become redundant. $COUNTRY$ is unrecognisable when compared to a mere 50 years ago, and it is best to move on from the bitter infighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111032;It's for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111035;The Future of Tibet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111035;The continued security of $COUNTRY$ increasingly rests on securing our western frontiers. To this end, it has been suggested that we seek expansion westward, by annexing Tiber in particular. The more conservative members of the government favour a conquest, while the more liberal ministers want $COUNTRY$ to have stronger ties with an independent, but allied, Tibetan state. There is, of course, also the middle option, making Tibet a client state of $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111035;The empire is overextended already!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB2111035;Annexation is the best option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC2111035;Vassalisation might be the wisest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111036;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands our Vassalisation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111036;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has handed our representatives an ultimatum which amounts to Tibet being reduced to a mere client state of $FROMCOUNTRY$. This is obviously hugely insulting, but there is also the matter of the vast manpower of $FROMCOUNTRY$ compared to $COUNTRY$. We need to consider our next move wisely, taking into account that $FROMCOUNTRY$ could have declared a war war of conquest us without even offering vassalisation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111036;A hard pill to swallow, but vassalisation is the only realistic option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB2111036;We will not be reduced to a vassal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111037;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts Vassalisation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111037;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has accepted our reasonable offer of vassalisation, and our two countries can look to a safer and stronger future as friends and allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111037;Ten thousand years!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111038;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Rejects Vassalisation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111038;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused our reasonable offer of vassalisation - there is now only one way out of this crisis, and it involves the loss of countless $COUNTRY_ADJ$ and $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111038;For $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111071;Discontent Among the Granjeros;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111071;The collapse of much of the Spanish and Portuguese colonial empires in the 18th century has allowed $COUNTRY$, as well as Britain and Italy, to expand into former Iberian colonial possessions in southern Africa. While we have established our control over those territories, the local population, known as Granjeros, or Farmers, remains largely defiant of our control. In typical European fashion, they view us as inferior to them and calls for Granjero self-governance, or outright independence, are growing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111071;Let them govern themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB2111071;This is not an option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111072;The Republic of Sudáfrica;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111072;Discontent among the European population of $COUNTRY$, descendents of Portuguese and Spanish settlers in their conquered former south African domains, known as Granjeros, have boiled over into open violence. White settlers have overthrown the local administration in the southernmost provinces and declared an independent republic. A mass exodus of whites from $COUNTRY$ has seen the local Granjero population greatly reduced, although large numbers of white settlers still remain in $COUNTRY$, refusing to abandon the former colonies to so-called uncivilised powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111072;Damnation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111073;The Kilwan Menace;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111073;Having emancipated ourselves from the rule of the Kilwa Sultanate, we must ensure that $COUNTRY$ retains her independence. To this end, we should seek an alliance with our European neighbours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111073;Send envoys immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111074;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Requests Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111074;Having emancipated themselves from the rule of the Kilwa Sultanate, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities are desperately trying to retain the independence of $FROMCOUNTRY$ and deter a Kilwan invasion. To this end, they seek an alliance with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111074;We will accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB2111074;This is not a problem of ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111091;Widespread Instability in $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111091;The situation in the provinces is becoming increasingly uncotrollable. There are reports of vast networks of revolutionaries plotting the overthrow of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule, and that does not even factor in Western interventionism! Violance among the ethnic groups is becoming commonplace, and $COUNTRY$ is bursting at the seams - so much so that the Great Powers have taken it upon themselves to resolve this issue for us. And also without us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111091;More damned Western interventionism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111092;Mamluk Instability;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111092;The situation in the provinces of the Mamluk Sultanate is becoming increasingly uncotrollable. Violance among the ethnic groups is becoming commonplace, and $COUNTRY$ is bursting at the seams. A violent implosion of the Mamluk state would negatively impact all the powers with interests in the Near East, and so it is best that the Great Powers deal with the issue instead of leaving it to the Mamluks themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111092;Sounds reasonable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111093;The Mamluk Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111093;The so-called Mamluk Question has become a prominent topic at ongoing summit on African affairs. The situation in the provinces of the Mamluk Sultanate is becoming increasingly uncotrollable. Violance among the ethnic groups is becoming commonplace, and the country is bursting at the seams. A violent implosion of the Mamluk state would negatively impact all the powers with interests in the Near East, and so it is best that the Great Powers deal with the issue instead of leaving it to the Mamluks themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111093;Sounds reasonable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111094;The Mamluk Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111094;The so-called Mamluk Question has become a prominent topic at ongoing summit on African affairs, and the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has suggested it be resolved at the conference. The situation in the provinces of the Mamluk Sultanate is becoming increasingly uncotrollable. Violance among the ethnic groups is becoming commonplace, and the country is bursting at the seams. A violent implosion of the Mamluk state would negatively impact all the powers with interests in the Near East, and so it is best that the Great Powers deal with the issue instead of leaving it to the Mamluks themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111094;The breakup of the Sultanate has been a long time coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB2111094;A strong Mamluk state is desirable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111095;The Mamluks Supported;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111095;The Great Powers have decided to support $COUNTRY$ and its territorial integrity. For now it seems that Western support has saved the Sultanate, but it remains to be seen whether the rising tide of nationalism within $COUNTRY$ will make the issue resurface soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111095;Ya hala!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111096;The Breakup of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111096;The Great Powers have decided to break up $COUNTRY$. In the dark corridors of European capitals, without the involvement of any $COUNTRY_ADJ$ representatives, the Sultanate was dismembered to serve Western interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111096;A dark day in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ history!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111097;The Dismantlement of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111097;The Great Powers have decided to completely dismantle $COUNTRY$. In the dark corridors of European capitals, without the involvement of any $COUNTRY_ADJ$ representatives, the Sultanate was dismembered to serve Western interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111097;A dark day in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ history!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111098;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111098;Following the decision of the Great Powers to dismantle the Mamluk Sultanate, $COUNTRY$ has emerged as an independent nation. What does the future hold for us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111098;Only greatness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111099;Our Future;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111099;The recent conference which dismantled our Sultanate has come to an end. Not satisfied with the damage they have already done, the Western powers are now deciding our own future. Opinions range from our being turned into a Western colony, to full independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111099;May Allah have mercy on their souls for what they did!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111102;The Future of $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111102;The recent conference which dismantled $FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to an end, and the other Great Powers have agreed that it is within our remit to decide the Mamluks' future. There are three schools of thought on the issue, and we must choose wisely - or risk a costly war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111102;Vassalisation seems to be the most reasonable option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB2111102;Annexation will provide the most benefits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME2111103;The Future of $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111103;The recent conference which dismantled the Mamluks has created a number of new states, and the other Great Powers have agreed that it is within our remit to decide future of $FROMCOUNTRY$. There are three schools of thought on the issue, and we must choose wisely - or risk a costly war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110151;The Residential School System;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110151;It has been suggested that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government set up a number of special schools for the "re-education" of the indigenous peoples inside our borders. The more left-wing amost the government have raised serious concerns about these programmes, particularly given the fact that children's attendance to these residential schools will not be optional, but the reactionary and nationalist factions insist that it is necessary in order to ensure national unity and a proper Western education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110151;Let's do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110151;No, it isn't right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110152;Abolishing the Residential School System;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110152;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government's policy of establishing residential schools for indigenous people has caused untold emotional and physical damage to our indigenous population. It is time to abolish the system and begin the healing process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110152;Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2110153;The Horrors of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Residential School System;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2110153;An explosive government report has been leaked in $COUNTRY$, detailing the methods used by schools in order to indoctrinate indigenous children into Western culture by severing them from their indigenous heritage in a network of schools colloquially called the 'residential school system'. The report also lists widespread abuse, malnourishment, and a general lack of care for the welfare of the children. There are also instances of resident children perishing while in the schools - causing outrage among the population of not only $COUNTRY$, but the entire world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2110153;This is unconscionable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111141;$CAPITAL$ on the Verge of Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111141;The revolutionary wave that has swept through the Mediterranean, first in the Mamluks of all places, and then in Portugal, France, and most recently Italy, is now rampant in Austria. We tried in vain to stop the spread of revolutionary ideas, but since the dismantlement of much of the Austrian empire by Italy in the war of 1809-1815, revolutionary and anti-monarchist ideas have spread like wildfire through the cities and much of the countryside. Vienna is a powder keg on the verge of a cataclysmic explosion, and it is no longer a matter of if there will be an Austrian Revolution, but when.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111141;We must defend the Emperor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB2111141;Es lebe die Österreichische Republik!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111142;The Austrian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111142;Revolution has gripped the streets of $CAPITAL$, the latest in a string of European capitals to fall to Radical rebels. Despite a concerted effort by the Imperial authorities to stop any attempts at Revolution, the Austrian monarchy has been deposed and a Republic proclaimed. The Imperial government and its loyalist troops resisted, and so Karl I has been publicly executed for crimes against the Austrian nation. The new administration swiftly abolished the last remnants of feudalism, enacted democratic reform, and moved to secure the safety of the new Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA2111142;The horror!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2111143;The Triumph of the Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111143;Despite the best efforts of the Imperial government, Revolutionary banners now fly over $CAPITAL$.

EVTNAME2111144;The End of the Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2111144;With the glory days of the Revolution now behind us, it is becoming increasingly hard to maintain an almost absolute Radical hold on power in $COUNTRY$.

vienna.001.T;Tensions in Austria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.001.D;Since the dismantlement of the Holy Roman Empire and its Imperial hegemon, Austria, central Europe and the balkans have been plunged into chaos. Austria is a powderkeg of discontent, Bulgaria has emerged as a regional troublemaker by conquering parts of Serbia and Hungary through sheer skill, and northern Germany remains a collection of bickering principalities and kingdoms. Though the tide of Revolution sweeping through the continent is at this point unstoppable, it has been suggested that we host an international summit of the Great Powers in order to some semblance of order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

vienna.002.1;We will attend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.002.2;We have other matters to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.003.T;The Congress of $CAPITAL$ Begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.003.D;Diplomatic representatives of the Great Powers of Europe have gathered in $CAPITAL$ today to begin formal talks over tensions in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Discussions over the Imperial possessions of the Great Powers in the region, particularly those of France and Italy, are off the table - nor have most of the nations whose fate is to be decided by the Congress of $CAPITAL$ been invited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.003.1;Enough chit-chat, let's get down to business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.004.T;The Austrian Collapse;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.004.D;The first order of business at the Congress is the issue of Austria, which has had a spectacular fall from grace in just a single generation. Where once it ruled over an empire spanning Central Europe and much of the Balkans, and headed the Holy Roman Empire, it now lies dismembered, humiliated at the hands of a revanchist Italian Republic, and tittering on the brink of total anarchy. There are three possible solutions to the issue: give Austria the right to reassert her dominance over the South Germans and keep her Balkan possessions, only allow her to reassert herself in Central Europe, or dismantle her completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.004.1;Restoration would ensure stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.004.2;Only allow Austria to reassert herself locally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.004.3;Austria has proven herself incapable of keeping order - dismantle her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.005.T;Austria Supported;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.005.D;The Great Powers have decided to allow Austria to reassert her control over both the South Germans and the territories she how holds in the Balkans and elsewhere. Fears of a dismantlement of the country can now be put to rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.005.1;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.006.T;Austria Dismembered;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.006.D;The Great Powers have decided to allow Austria to reassert her control over the South Germans, for the sake of local stability and for ensuring she remains a relevant regional power. She will not be allowed, however, to keep her possessions in the Balkans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.006.1;We must accept the demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.006.2;We will not accept this humiliation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.007.T;Austria Dismantled;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.007.D;The Great Powers have given in to their darkest desires, and completely dismantled the Austrian state - apparently, anarchy and squabbling between a myriad states is more desirable that a relatively harmless, but stable, Austrian-led South German state. Austria will now be restricted to those few territories which once were the core of the Habsburg realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.007.1;We must accept the demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.007.2;We will not accept this humiliation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.008.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses the Demands of the Congress of $CAPITAL$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.008.D;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has flat-out refused the demands of the Congress of $CAPITAL$! There seems to be way to enforce them now, other than humiliating $FROMCOUNTRY$ on the battlefield, all in the service of continental stability of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.008.1;They will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.014.T;The Bulgarian Juggernaut;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.014.D;The Balkan states, having first won their independence from a crumbling Austria during the Austro-Italian War of 1809-1819, immediately descended into warfare as tensions between Serbia and Bulgaria boiled over. Bulgaria, aided by Russia, managed to secure significant gains from the nascent Serbian state in 1815. Three years later, Bulgaria and Russia launched a joint invasion of Bosnia, aiming to increase Bulgarian control over more south Slavic territory. In the aftermath of these wars, Bulgaria and Russia have managed to extend Bulgarian control as far north as Hungary, but at the cost of regional stability and peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.014.1;A strong Bulgarian state would be beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.014.2;We do not care either way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.014.3;Return the conquered lands to Serbia, Hungary, and Bosnia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.015.T;The Bulgarian Compromise;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.015.D;The Great Powers have decided that a strong Bulgarian state in the Balkans is in their interests, as it will guarantee peace and stability. They have agreed that Bulgaria should be allowed to keep some of the lands she has conquered between 1815 and 1819, but have also demanded the return of some of the conquered territory to Serbia and Hungary in order to ease tensions and ensure a regional balance of power. They have also agreed that Serbia should be allowed to annex Bosnia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.015.1;Not the best we would have hoped for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.015.2;We will not accept this humiliation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.016.T;Bulgaria Dismembered;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.016.D;The Great Powers have decided that the recent expansion of Bulgaria into Hungarian, Serbian, and Bosnian lands has destabilised the region too greatly, and that the only way to ensure regional stability is to force a return of most of the conquered lands back to Hungary, Serbia, and Bosnia. Bulgaria will be allowed to keep some of her conquered territory, but she will be greatly reduced in size.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.016.1;We must accept the demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.016.2;We will not accept this humiliation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.017.T;Bulgaria Dismantled;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.017.D;The Great Powers have decided that the recent expansion of Bulgaria into Hungarian, Serbian, and Bosnian lands has destabilised the region too greatly, and that the only way to ensure regional stability is to force a return of all of the conquered lands back to Hungary, Serbia, and Bosnia. Bulgaria will henceforth be cut down to size and reduced solely to Balkan provinces with a Bulgarian minority, in line with the general trend in post-Revolutionary Europe of creating nation-states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.017.1;We must accept the demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.017.2;We will not accept this humiliation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.024.T;Bohemian Expansionism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.024.D;Taking advantage of the collapse of the Habsburg Empire over the last twenty years, Bohemia has embarked on a series of expansionist military campaigns in continental Europe with the aim of reclaiming her title as a major player in continental affairs. Bohemian expansionism has worried primarily Italy and Russia, who view an aggressive Bohemian state as a threat to their regional interests. As with the Balkans, Bohemian conquests in territories inhabited by Germans and Poles has created explosive tensions, and threatens the stability of all states in central Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.024.1;A strong Bohemia will ensure stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.024.2;We do not care either way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.024.3;Cut Bohemia down to a more manageable size.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.025.T;Bohemia Supported;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.025.D;The Great Powers have decided that a strong Bohemian state in central Europe will offer the best way to ensure stability. To that end, they have agreed that recent Bohemian conquests on the continent should be recognised as valid Bohemian land, and left in the control of a strong Bohemian state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.025.1;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.026.T;Bohemia Dismembered;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.026.D;The Great Powers have decided that Bohemian expansionism poses a serious threat to the stability of continental Europe, and have demanded that the Bohemian administration return the lands it has recently conquered from Poland and her other neighbours over the past two decades. Additionally, the Congress decreed that a stronger Ausburg and Saxony are also desirable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.026.1;We must accept the demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.026.2;We will not accept this humiliation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.027.T;Bohemia Dismantled;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.027.D;The Great Powers have decided that Bohemian expansionism poses a terminal threat to the stability of continental Europe, and have demanded that near-dismantlement of the Bohemian state in favour of a more balance series of minor continental powers, none of which could pose any serious threat to the Great Powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.027.1;We must accept the demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.027.2;We will not accept this humiliation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.034.T;Dutch Unionism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.034.D;In the spirit of nationalism that is sweeping through the continent of Europe, the small state of Holland is pressuring the Great Powers to allow it to unify the various lands of the Dutch people into a single state, to be called the Netherlands. Dutch officials are going so far so as to suggest that this new state could include the Flemish people of Liège, or could even fully annex the state of Liège entirely and bring the French-speaking Waloons under Dutch domination. France in particular is not keen on this idea, as they view a potential unified Dutch state to be primarily in the interests of the United Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.034.1;We favour an expanded Holland only.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.034.2;Allow the creation of the Netherlands, but without the Waloons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.034.3;Allow the Netherlands to fully annex Liège.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.035.T;Greater Holland Unified;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.035.D;The Great Powers have decided that the various small Dutch states in the Low Countries should be annexed by Holland, in order to ensure regional stability and to facilitate greater trade and development. Hopes of a united Netherlands, or even the annexation of Liège, have been dashed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.035.1;Lang leve Holland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.036.T;Annexation by Holland;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.036.D;In line with the recent Congress of the Great Powers, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has demanded that we comply with the decisions of the congress and peacefully surrended our authority over to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.036.1;We have no choice but to comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.036.2;We will not be annexed just like that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.037.T;The Netherlands Created;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.037.D;The Great Powers have decided that all Dutch-speaking peoples in the Low Countries should be unified into a single Dutch state, to be called the Netherlands. To the great dissatisfaction of Liège, they have agreed to allow the new state to annex the Flemish-speaking parts of the country, including the city of Brussels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.037.1;Lang leve Nederland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.038.T;The Greater Netherlands Created;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.038.D;The Great Powers have decided that all Dutch-speaking peoples in the Low Countries should be unified into a single Dutch state, to be called the Netherlands. To the surprise of many, they have also agreed to allow the new state to annex the theocratic state of Liège and its large number of Dutch-speaking inhabitants, to the great dissatisfaction of the French-speaking Waloons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.038.1;Lang leve Nederland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.044.T;The German Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.044.D;The final big issue to be resolved at the ongoing conference is that of Germany. Until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire at the hands of Italy, the various German states were quasi-united into a loose confederation. Over the past two decades, however, the region has dissolved into armed conflict. We can re-establish a German Confederation, but this could lead to calls for more German unification - a unified Germany could pose a threat to the current balance of power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.044.1;Support a new German Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.044.2;We cannot support this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.045.T;German Confederation Created;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.045.D;The Great Powers have decided to put an end to German infighting by creating a new German Confederation to take the place of the old Holy Roman Empire. It is hoped that this new loose confederacy of independent states will bring stability to the region. Others fear that this could be the spark that ignites the powderkeg of pan-Germanism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.045.1;Es lebe die deutsche Einheit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.046.T;Hopes for a German Confederation Quashed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.046.D;The Great Powers have decided that any attempt at even a loose confederacy of German states could be the spark that ignites the powderkeg of pan-Germanism - something that the Great Powers cannot allow as it would bring on a major realignment in the continental balance of power. The German states will stay disunited for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.046.1;A major setback to German aims!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.054.T;Continental Spheres of Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.054.D;The Conference of the Great Powers is drawing to a close, as the participants have began to agree their respective spheres of influence. The initial drawing of spheres on the continent is expected to be easy, as there is general agreement among the Great Powers concerning many countries, but fierce negotiations are expected when the discussions shift towards more minor states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.054.1;More imperialism, great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.055.T;The Great Powers and $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.055.D;The Great Powers are currently discussing whose sphere of influence $COUNTRY$ should be a part of. We are not privy to those discussions, and much to the dissatisfaction of our government it is expected that the Great Powers will just declare to us the result of their discussions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.055.1;More imperialism, great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.099.T;The End of the Conference of $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
vienna.099.D;The Congress of $CAPITAL$ has finally come to an end, as the Great Powers are now more or less satisfied with what was agreed. Hopefully it will ensure stability and peace on the continent, although it has been agreed that force may be used against states which refuse to comply with the agreements signed at $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SIS.001.T;The Shanghai International Settlement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.001.D;The top $COUNTRY_ADJ$ economic advisers have suggested that $COUNTRY$ establish an international settlement in the Chinese Treaty Port of Shanghai, which is currently leased to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. They claim that, by ceding the territory to a local administration made up of the commercial interests of various European powers, it will be possible to increase the profit extracted from the territory many times over, thanks to free trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.001.1;Let's do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.001.2;Shanghai is $COUNTRY_ADJ$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.002.T;A Concession in Shanghai;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.002.D;We have decided to petition for a concession at the Shanghai International Settlement. This could potentially be very lucrative for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.002.1;Send the application.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.003.T;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Concession in Shanghai?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.003.D;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has decided to petition for a concession at the Shanghai International Settlement, where we hold a minor recognised concession. Should we allow them to gain a concession themselves, and take a share of the profits from trade with China?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.003.1;Give them a concession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.003.2;Not at present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.004.T;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Concession in Shanghai?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.004.D;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has decided to petition for a concession at the Shanghai International Settlement, where we hold a major recognised concession. Should we allow them to gain a concession themselves, and take a share of the profits from trade with China?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.004.1;Give them a minor concession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.004.2;Give them a major concession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.004.3;Not at present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.005.T;Concession Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.005.D;The powers with control over the Shanghai International Settlement have decided not to allow us to set up a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ zone within the territory controlled by the SIS.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.005.1;We don't need them anyway!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.006.T;Minor Concession Allowed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.006.D;The powers with control over the Shanghai International Settlement have decided to allow us to set up a small $COUNTRY_ADJ$ zone within the territory controlled by the SIS. This will mean fewer profits, but also potentially fewer losses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.006.1;Not as good as it could have been, but better than nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.007.T;Major Concession Allowed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.007.D;The powers with control over the Shanghai International Settlement have decided to allow us to set up a major $COUNTRY_ADJ$ zone within the territory controlled by the SIS. This will mean greater profits, but also potentially greater losses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.007.1;Splendid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.008.T;The $YEAR$ Financial Report;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.008.D;Every few years, the municipal administration of the Shanghai International Settlement redistributes the profits generated by the joint enterprise to the various powers that hold concessions in the SIS. The time has come to see what this year's report says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.008.1;Let us see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.009.T;Huge Profit Margins in Shanghai;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.009.D;The corporate-municipal government of the Shanghai International Settlement has handed out dividents based on the profits generated by the various enterprises operating within the SIS. This year has been exceptional, and we received far more than expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.009.1;Splended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.011.T;Profits from Shanghai;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.011.D;The corporate-municipal government of the Shanghai International Settlement has handed out dividents based on the profits generated by the various enterprises operating within the SIS. This year has been good, but we expected a higher yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.011.1;Better than a loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.013.T;Losses in Shanghai;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.013.D;The corporate-municipal government of the Shanghai International Settlement has informed us that no dividents will be handed out this year, given that the settlement made a loss over the last financial cycle due to an ongoing market realignment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.013.1;We knew this was a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.015.T;The Rise of Chinese Jazz;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.015.D;In the Chinese city Shanghai, the centre of European influence upon China for decades, a curious musical union is happening: local Chinese musicians have began to use Western musical instruments used in Jazz, and fusing them with more traditional Chinese folk sounds. This has lead to the creation of a local Shanghailander subgenre of Jazz, which is beginning to be called "Shidaiqu" - "songs of the era". Though  not yet at the same level as Western forms of Jazz, experts claim that the seeds for something great have been sown.

SIS.016.T;The Rise of Chinese Jazz;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.016.D;Shanghai, long ago stolen from us by the Western powers, is now a hotbed of Western culture on the doorstep of China. As if this was not enough, Chinese musicians in Shanghai have began to fuse proper Chinese music with the Western genre known as Jazz, to a new subgenre called"Shidaiqu" - "songs of the era". Western cultural imperialism is spreading everywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.016.1;Traitorous music!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.017.T;The Magnificence of the Shanghai Bund;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.017.D;The Chinese port city of Shanghai, for decades a European settlement, has seen a remarkable transformation over the past decades. Nowhere is this more evident than in the magnificent Bund, its harbour promenade lined with magnificent skyscrapers occupied by the numerous banks, insurance companies, and other commercial interests in Shanghai and the wider Chinese world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SIS.017.1;China is changing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR.001.T;The Spanish Government in Galicia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR.001.D;Since the disasterous, from the Spanish perspective, campaigns against Spain by Aragon between 1700 and 1806, the previously-unified Kingdom of Spain has been pushed further and further towards the Atlantic. As it stands, it currently only holds Galicia - lands which are, of right, $COUNTRY_ADJ$. It has been suggested that we make a formal claim on those lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR.001.1;We will claim all of it as our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR.001.2;We are not the only ones claiming Galicia, let us split it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

IBR.003.D;Since the disasterous, from the Spanish perspective, campaigns against Spain by Aragon between 1700 and 1806, the previously-unified Kingdom of Spain has been pushed further and further towards the Atlantic. As it stands, it currently only holds Galicia - lands which a foreign government has recently laid claim on. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us asking for an alliance against aggressive actions aimed at their annexation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR.003.1;Let us aid them in their time of need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR.003.2;We must sadly decline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR.004.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts Alliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

IBR.006.1;Galicia is rightfully ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR.006.2;We have no interest in this at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR.007.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Contests our Claims;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR.007.D;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has decided to contest our claim over Galicia, insisting that the region is theirs by right. It seems that hopes of a swift and decisive resolution of the Galician issue have been dashed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR.007.1;We cannot allow this humiliation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR.007.2;Let us not escalate this further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

IBR.008.1;All of Galicia is rightfully ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR.008.2;Let us partition it between us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

IBR.010.D;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has decided to agree to our proposal that Galicia be split between our countries, to avoid any border conflicts developing in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

IBR.011.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has No Interest in Galicia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
IBR.011.D;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has informed us that they have no interest in Galicia, leaving our claim on the region uncontested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
